## Select a genome, then download the corresponding FASTA file

### Using Mycoplasma haemofelis genome:

__The size of the file__

The size of the file is 1.2 megabytes

__The total size of the genome__ 

The genome is 1147259 base pairs long

__The number of chromosomes in the genome__ 

Mycoplasma haemofelis contains one chromosome

__The name and length of each chromosome in the genome__ 

The name of the chromosome isNC_014970.1 and the length of it is 1147259 base pairs long

## Generate a simulated FASTQ output for a sequencing instrument of your choice. Set the parameters so that your target coverage is 10x.

### Using Mycoplasma haemofelis genome:

__How many reads have you generated?__

To account for 10x target coverage I generated 60000 reads per read pair as the total length for my genome was 1147259 base pairs

__What is the average read length?__

The average read length was 100 base pairs

__How big are the FASTQ files?__

The FASTQ files are each 15 megabytes

__Compress the files and report how much space that saves.__

When the files become compressed they are now 2.7 megabytes saving 12.3 megabytes of space.
